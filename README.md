Dairy Sales Dashboard

üéØ Objective

The objective of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze and visualize dairy sales performance across different product categories, sales channels, and operational factors such as shelf life and storage conditions. The dashboard aims to help decision-makers in the dairy business:

Monitor total sales and revenue distribution.

Understand the relationship between product shelf life, storage conditions, and expiration trends.

Evaluate performance across sales channels and product categories.

Identify operational efficiencies linked to production factors (like the number of cows).

üìä Key Insights

Total Sales Overview

The total dairy sales amount to ‚Çπ254.03 billion, indicating strong overall market performance.

Shelf Life Analysis

Ghee has the longest shelf life, making it a stable product for long-term storage and distribution.

Curd and Paneer have the shortest shelf lives, requiring efficient cold chain and quick sales turnover.

Expiration Trends

Expiration counts are evenly distributed across major products (Paneer, Yogurt, Butter, Ghee, and Cheese), showing balanced production management.

Revenue by Product

Curd and Butter generate the highest revenue, suggesting strong consumer demand.

Products like Cheese and Yogurt contribute comparatively less but can be optimized through marketing or pricing strategies.

Revenue by Number of Cows

Farms with 35 cows show the highest total revenue, implying optimal productivity at this scale.

Increasing herd size doesn‚Äôt necessarily guarantee higher revenue ‚Äî efficiency matters more than scale.

Sales Channel Performance

Retail leads in revenue contribution (‚Çπ21M), followed by Online (‚Çπ20M) and Wholesale (‚Çπ18M).

The growing parity between online and retail indicates a strong digital shift in dairy product purchases.

Storage Condition Impact

Poor storage conditions significantly reduce shelf life (notably below 10 days).

Enhanced storage infrastructure could extend product life and reduce waste.
